This package provides tools and utilities to facilitate communication and integration between Python and Flutter applications. WITHOUT any external api such as FastAPI or Flask, or any HTTP servers.

Benefits:
- Seamless integration between Python and Flutter
- No need for external APIs or HTTP servers
- Simplified communication between backend and frontend
- Improved development workflow and productivity

Goals:
- Provide an easy-to-use bridging solution between Flutter and Python, where Flutter can call ANY Python function directly. Where Python codes must be located in the same directory as the Flutter project, or by specifying the path to the Python files.
